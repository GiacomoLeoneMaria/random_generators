Several implementations are implemented in the program for generating pseudo-random numbers extracted from :

    a uniform distribution using Linear congruential generator
    an exponential distribution
    a Gaussian distribution with the Box-Muller method.
    a Gaussian distribution with the accept-reject method. 

    The Linear congruential generator uses as parameters the values m_a = 1664525, m_c = 1013904223 and m_m = 231.

 In the main.cpp file the accept-reject method is implemented as an example with different parameters. 

In order to compile and execute the file you need to have ROOT - CERN installed on your computer for the histogram plot.
